Feature: Test Amazon search functionality

    @Cart
    Scenario Outline: As a Customer when I search for Alexa, I wantto see if the third option on the second page is available for purchase and can be added to the cart.
    Given the user navigates to www.amazon.com
    And searches for <Product>
    And navigates to the page number 2
    And selects the third item
    Then the user is able to add it to the cart

    Examples:
        |Product    |
        |Alexa      |
